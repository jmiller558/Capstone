### Project Name: 
* #### SuperPlan: Forecasting and Demand Planning 

### Team Name: 
* #### Estrella Ndrianasy, Jesse Miller, Jyoti Kumari, Kanika Mahajan, Kevin Lu

## Project Overview: 

* #### Demand planning is the process of planning demand for a product or service in order to facilitate decisions about inventory levels, production capacities, staffing, and more. Demand planning is considered an essential step in supply chain planning.

## Project Objectives

* #### Our project leverages the M5 Competitionâ€™s Walmart sales dataset, which covers several stores in multiple states in the US. The M5 is one of the most well-known forecasting competitions in the field of demand planning.We explore top performing models from the M5, particularly LightGBM, and state-of-the-art deep learning models like Temporal Fusion Transformer against industry standards such as Triple Exponential Smoothing, in order to provide key insights to business users including: 
  * Which aggregation levels do the models forecast best?
    * Are the models effective at capturing price/promo changes?
    * And do the model perform well in common business scenarios not covered by the M5?
