### Project Name: 
* #### SuperPlan: Forecasting and Demand Planning 

### Team Members:
* #### Estrella Ndrianasy, Jesse Miller, Jyoti Kumari, Kanika Mahajan, Kevin Lu

## Project Objectives

#### Our project leverages the M5 Competitionâ€™s Walmart sales dataset, which covers several stores in multiple states in the US. The M5 is one of the most well-known forecasting competitions in the field of demand planning. We explore top performing models from the M5, particularly LightGBM, and state-of-the-art deep learning models like Temporal Fusion Transformer against industry standards such as Triple Exponential Smoothing, in order to provide key insights to business users including: 
    * Which aggregation levels do the models forecast best?
    * Are the models effective at capturing price/promo changes?
    * And do the model perform well in common business scenarios not covered by the M5?
